<h1>Information</h1>

<h2>The purpose of this site</h2>
<p>This site is designed to make tracking different aspects of Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail
much easier. Allowing for both games to be basically played on automatically.
using this site you can make a plan on what characters you are going to get and how long you will
need in order to build them. </p>

<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p>Im thinking about adding in more functionality for artifacts. such as comparison as well as
some sort of storage for uploading to optimisation websites. There might also be a few more
ideas but I'll get to them when I get to them</p>

<h2>Honkai Impact 3rd</h2>
<p>I really like HI3 but im not familiar with the intrinsic details of the game in the same way as
Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail. Maybe I can think of something</p>

<h2>Non-Mihoyo Games</h2>
<p>As far as that goes i have a few programs relating to Call Of Duty and the like. i can add them into 
a misc page in the future.</p>
